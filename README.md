# 🐍 Object-Oriented Programming in Python – Lab Repository

This repository contains solutions and lab exercises for the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python** course.  
Each lab covers a different set of Python concepts, ranging from basic syntax to OOP applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### Lab 1 – Basics of Python
- `Decimal place.py` → Program to format numbers to a specific decimal place.  
- `area.py` → Calculates area of basic shapes (circle, rectangle, etc.).  
- `calculator.py` → Simple calculator with arithmetic operations.  

### Lab 2 – Conditionals & Loops
- `Distance.py` → Program to calculate distance (formula-based).  
- `grade.py` → Grade calculator based on marks.  
- `listsum.py` → Sum of elements in a list using iteration.  

### Lab 3 – Strings & Functions
- `Palindrome.py` → Checks if a string/number is a palindrome.  
- `prime.py` → Program to check if a number is prime.  
- `type.py` → Demonstrates type checking and conversions in Python.  

### Lab 4 – Notebook
- `Lab 4 Python.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with exercises (mix of concepts).  

### Lab 5 – Notebook + Extended
- `LAB 5 Python.ipynb` → Notebook with lab problems (intro to OOP).  
- `Pyhton Lab 5 pt2.ipynb` → Extended problems and exercises (typo in name kept as in original).  

### Lab 6 – OOP in Python
- `Lab 6 Python.py` → Programs covering OOP principles (classes, objects, inheritance, etc.).  

### Lab 7 – Mini Project
- `Lab 7 Python ATM.ipynb` → ATM simulation using classes and OOP principles.
